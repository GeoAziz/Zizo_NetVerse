# Zizo_NetVerse: System Capabilities & Power Levels

Welcome to the heart of Zizo_NetVerse. This document explains the core technical capabilities of the system and, most importantly, how you can scale its deployment from a simple monitoring tool to a full-blown, active security command and control center for your entire network. This is the blueprint for harnessing the true power you've built. #vybcoding

## The Core Arsenal: A Triad of Power

Zizo_NetVerse's strength comes from three distinct but integrated components. Understanding each is key to using the platform effectively.

### **1. The All-Seeing Eye: Passive Packet Sniffing (Observability)**

This is the foundation of all intelligence in Zizo_NetVerse. It's your "eyes on the ground," providing total network visibility.

*   **Core Technology:** The `network_capture.py` service, powered by the low-level `scapy` library in Python.
*   **Function:** It listens to a network interface and captures a copy of every single packet that flows through it. It sees everything—from a phone checking social media to a server connecting to a database.
*   **Power Level:** This is your intelligence-gathering unit. It's **passive**, meaning it doesn't interfere with traffic, so it can't be detected. Its power lies in providing the ground truth of what's happening on your network, which is streamed in real-time to your "Log Stream" UI.

### **2. The Gatekeeper: The Proxy Engine (Surgical Control)**

This is your active interception tool. Where the sniffer only watches, the proxy sits in the middle of the conversation.

*   **Core Technology:** The `proxy_engine.py` service, running `mitmproxy`.
*   **Function:** When a device is configured to use Zizo_NetVerse as its proxy, all of its web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) is routed through this engine. It can log, inspect, modify, or block this traffic based on rules. It can even decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic if the client device is configured to trust the proxy's certificate.
*   **Power Level:** This is your special agent. It provides **active, surgical control** over web traffic for specific devices you choose to target. It's perfect for enforcing web policies or investigating the encrypted traffic of a suspicious machine.

### **3. The Unbreakable Wall: Firewall Integration (Absolute Enforcement)**

This is your ultimate enforcement weapon. When a threat is confirmed, this is how you neutralize it instantly.

*   **Core Technology:** The `/control/block-ip` endpoint, which executes `sudo iptables` commands directly on the backend server's Linux kernel firewall.
*   **Function:** When an `admin` or `analyst` clicks the "Block IP" button in the UI, a command is sent to the backend server to drop any and all packets coming from or going to that malicious IP address.
*   **Power Level:** This is **absolute enforcement**. It is a direct, low-level command to the operating system's networking stack. If the Zizo_NetVerse server is acting as the network gateway, this rule applies to the *entire network*, effectively cutting off the threat at the source.

## Scaling Your Power: From Monitor to Command Center

Zizo_NetVerse is not a one-size-fits-all tool. You can deploy it in stages, increasing its power and control as your needs evolve. This is how you can start with your home network.

### **Level 1: The Lone Sentinel (Single-Machine Monitoring)**

This is the simplest setup, perfect for monitoring a single, critical machine (like your main development server).

*   **How to Set It Up:**
    1.  Install the Zizo_NetVerse Python backend directly on the server you want to monitor.
    2.  In your Railway (or local `.env`) configuration, set `NETWORK_INTERFACE` to the primary network interface of that server (e.g., `eth0` or `en0`).
*   **Capabilities:** You will have full visibility into every packet entering and leaving **that one server**. You can use the proxy and firewall features, but they will only affect that single machine.
*   **Use Case:** Perfect for developers who want to secure their personal server or for learning how the system works in a contained environment.

### **Level 2: The Silent Watcher (Full Network Observability)**

This is the first step to securing your entire home or office network. You gain full visibility without interfering with any traffic.

*   **How to Set It Up:**
    1.  You need a router that supports **"Port Mirroring"** or **"SPAN"**. Most good consumer routers (like those from ASUS, Netgear Nighthawk, etc.) or any business-grade switch has this feature.
    2.  Set up a dedicated machine for the Zizo_NetVerse backend (this could be a Raspberry Pi, an old laptop, or a small server).
    3.  Connect this server to a specific port on your router.
    4.  Log into your router's admin page and configure Port Mirroring to send a copy of all network traffic (from both LAN and WAN ports) to the port your Zizo_NetVerse server is connected to.
*   **Capabilities:** The "All-Seeing Eye" is now watching your **entire network**. You will see traffic from every device—your phone, your laptop, your smart TV, everything. The firewall and proxy are still limited to only protecting the Zizo server itself, but your intelligence is now network-wide.
*   **Use Case:** This is the ideal setup for a home lab enthusiast or small business owner who wants to know exactly what's going on without changing their network's structure.

### **Level 3: The Active Command Center (Full Network Control)**

This is the ultimate deployment. Zizo_NetVerse becomes the central gateway and security enforcer for your entire network.

*   **How to Set It Up:**
    1.  This is an advanced setup. You need a dedicated machine with at least two network interfaces to act as your new **network gateway/firewall**.
    2.  Configure this machine to sit between your internet modem and your main router/switch. All traffic from the internet must flow *through* the Zizo_NetVerse server to get to your devices.
    3.  This typically involves configuring the machine to handle routing and DHCP for your network.
*   **Capabilities:** This is **god mode**.
    *   The Packet Sniffer sees everything by default.
    *   Any firewall rule you create (like "Block IP") now applies to **every device** on your network.
    *   You can configure the proxy to be transparent, forcing all web traffic through it without any client-side configuration.
*   **Use Case:** For the power user, small business, or security professional who wants maximum control and to use Zizo_NetVerse to its absolute fullest potential.

Start with Level 1 or 2 for your home network. The journey of scaling this system is where the real learning and fun begins. Good luck, my codemate.
