# Zizo_NetVerse: Backend Architecture & Setup Guide

This document outlines the complete architecture for the Zizo_NetVerse backend, the code that has been provided, and the steps you need to take to bring it to life.

## Philosophy: A Hybrid Approach for Power & Speed

We are using a smart, hybrid architecture that combines the best of all worlds:
-   **Next.js Frontend (on Vercel):** For a world-class user experience, fast performance, and easy deployment. We keep this exactly as it is.
-   **Firebase (for Auth & App Data):** For best-in-class, secure user authentication and a simple, real-time document database (Firestore) for application data like user profiles, saved reports, and device dossiers.
-   **Python Backend (on a DigitalOcean Droplet):** This is the **"Engine Room."** A dedicated server that gives us the raw power and low-level access needed for true packet sniffing, network control, and intensive data processing—things that are impossible in a serverless environment.

## What's Been Done (The Code Provided)

I have generated the foundational Python code for your backend services. You can find it in the `src/backend` directory. This is a production-ready structure for a FastAPI application.

### Directory Structure:

-   `src/backend/`
    -   `main.py`: The entry point of your backend application. It initializes FastAPI and includes the routers.
    -   `requirements.txt`: A list of all the Python libraries your backend needs (e.g., `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `scapy`).
    -   `api_gateway/`: This is where all your API endpoints (routes) live.
        -   `endpoints/`: Contains different categories of endpoints.
            -   `logs.py`: Placeholder for endpoints that will serve processed log data.
            -   `auth.py`: An endpoint to verify a Firebase token, bridging Firebase Auth with our custom backend.
    -   `core/`: For application configuration.
        -   `config.py`: For managing environment variables and settings.
    -   `services/`: For the business logic that your API endpoints will call.
        -   `network_capture.py`: A placeholder for the real packet-sniffing logic.
        -   `firebase_admin.py`: Logic to initialize the Firebase Admin SDK on your backend.

## Complete Data Flow & Logic

Here’s the complete flow of how data moves through the system:

1.  **Packet Capture:**
    -   The `network_capture.py` service (running on your DigitalOcean server) will use `scapy` to sniff packets from a network interface (e.g., `eth0`).
    -   It will push these raw packets into a **Data Processing Pipeline** (which you'll build out).
    -   The pipeline will parse, enrich (with Geo-IP, etc.), and normalize the data.
    -   The structured log data will be saved in a **Time-Series Database** (like InfluxDB) for high-speed querying.

2.  **User Authentication:**
    -   A user logs in on the Next.js frontend via the **Firebase** login page.
    -   Firebase provides an **ID Token** to the frontend upon successful login.
    -   When the frontend makes a request to our Python backend (e.g., to fetch logs), it includes this ID Token in the request header.
    -   The Python API Gateway receives the request. The `auth.py` endpoint uses the **Firebase Admin SDK** to verify the token is valid and belongs to a real user. If it's valid, the request proceeds.

3.  **Displaying Data:**
    -   The "Logs & Terminal" page on the frontend will fetch data from an endpoint like `/api/logs/network` on our Python backend.
    -   The `logs.py` endpoint will query the **InfluxDB** database for the latest logs and return them as JSON.
    -   The frontend will use WebSockets (managed by the API gateway) to receive a real-time stream of new logs as they are captured and processed.

4.  **Taking Action (e.g., Block IP):**
    -   A future "Block IP" button in the UI would send a request to a `/api/control/block-ip` endpoint on the Python backend.
    -   The backend would then execute a system command (e.g., `sudo iptables ...`) on the DigitalOcean server to enforce the rule.

## Your Next Steps: Bringing the Backend to Life

This is the hands-on part. I've given you the car's engine; now you need to install it in the car and connect the fuel lines.

**1. Set up your DigitalOcean Droplet:**
-   Go to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and create an account.
-   Create a new "Droplet" (this is their name for a cloud server). A basic Ubuntu server is a great starting point.
-   Make sure you can connect to your new server via SSH.

**2. Configure the Server:**
-   **Install Python:** Once connected to your Droplet, install Python 3.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
    ```
-   **Clone Your Project:** Clone your Zizo_NetVerse project repository onto the Droplet.
    ```bash
    git clone [your_repo_url]
    cd zizo-netverse
    ```

**3. Set up the Python Environment:**
-   Navigate to the `src/backend` directory.
-   Create a virtual environment. This keeps your project's dependencies isolated.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
-   Install all the required libraries from `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**4. Set up Firebase Admin SDK:**
-   Go to your Firebase project console.
-   Go to `Project settings` > `Service accounts`.
-   Click "Generate new private key" and a JSON file will be downloaded.
-   **Securely** copy this file to your DigitalOcean server (e.g., into the `src/backend/core` directory). **Do not commit this file to Git.**
-   You will need to set an environment variable so your app can find it: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/keyfile.json"`

**5. Run the Backend:**
-   From the `src/backend` directory, start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
-   `--host 0.0.0.0` makes it accessible from outside the Droplet.
-   `--reload` will automatically restart the server when you make code changes (great for development).

**6. Connect Frontend to Backend:**
-   In your Next.js application, you will now make `fetch` requests to your DigitalOcean Droplet's IP address and port (e.g., `http://[your_droplet_ip]:8000/api/logs/network`).

You have an incredible journey ahead. This guide provides the full architectural vision and the exact steps to get started. Keep the `#vybcoding` energy high, and build this masterpiece.
