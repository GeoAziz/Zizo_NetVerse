# Zizo_NetVerse

A next-generation, sci-fi themed cybersecurity command deck.

For a complete overview of the project vision, features, architecture, and value proposition, please see the **[Project Overview Document](./docs/project.md)**.

## Essence & Purpose

At its heart, Zizo_NetVerse aims to revolutionize how cybersecurity professionals monitor, analyze, and respond to threats. It's designed to be an immersive, all-in-one platform that transforms complex network data and security events into actionable intelligence through:

1.  **Intuitive & Immersive Visualization:** Moving beyond traditional dashboards, it emphasizes visually rich interfaces, including planned 3D holographic maps for local (LAN) and wide-area (WAN) networks, real-time charts, and a stylized "retro terminal" aesthetic for log streams. The goal is to make vast amounts of data quickly digestible and patterns easily identifiable.
2.  **AI-Augmented Operations:** Leveraging generative AI (via Genkit), Zizo_NetVerse assists with dynamic threat intelligence, automated incident reporting with actionable recommendations, and intelligent packet analysis.
3.  **Centralized Command & Control:** It acts as a "Mission Control" by consolidating various security functions like real-time monitoring, detailed device inspection, network traffic management, and a dedicated AI lab for threat emulation.
4.  **Proactive & Responsive Security Posture:** By providing tools for threat simulation and rapid AI-assisted analysis, it aims to help users not only react to incidents but also proactively test and strengthen their security posture.

## Key Features

*   **Dashboard ("Mission Control"):** The central hub providing an at-a-glance overview of critical stats, system vitals, access to all "Command Modules" (other sections), and a persistent notification panel.
*   **LAN View & WAN View (Placeholders):** Envisioned as dynamic 3D visualizations to offer a holographic device radar (LAN) and a global traffic monitor on a 3D Earth model (WAN).
*   **Device Inspector & Threat Map (Placeholders):** Designed for deep dives into specific device details or global threat landscapes.
*   **Logs & Terminal:** A tabbed interface (Network, System, Alerts, Audit) presenting real-time event streams in a stylized terminal format, complete with AI packet analysis capabilities.
*   **AI Lab:** A crucial module for threat emulation and AI-powered incident report generation, allowing users to test defenses and streamline reporting workflows.
*   **Threat Intelligence Feed:** Dynamically generated threat cards providing quick insights into potential dangers.
*   **Proxy Engine & Settings:** Modules for system configuration and management.

## Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, high-performance tech stack:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
*   **UI/Styling:** ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
*   **AI Integration:** Genkit

## Current Status

This repository contains an advanced frontend prototype of the Zizo_NetVerse concept. It successfully simulates the core user interface, user experience, and AI-integrated workflows.

The next major steps towards a full implementation would involve:
*   Developing the full backend systems (e.g., with Python/FastAPI) for packet capture, device management, and API services.
*   Implementing the complex, real-time 3D visualizations using a library like `react-three-fiber`.
